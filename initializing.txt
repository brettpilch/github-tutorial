cd to the directory you want to track:
   cd ~ [go to home directory]
   cd .. [go up one directory]
   cd <directory> [go to <directory>]

initialize git repository:
   git init

   ls

add files to be tracked:
   git add <filename>

view status (show files that are tracked/untracked):
   git status

commit changes in tracked files to repository:
   git commit
   (this prompts you to enter a short message about the commit)

In github:

create a new empty repository (no readme file)
copy the url

Back in terminal:

   git remote add origin <url>

if you want to check the remotes:
   git remote (should display "origin" as the only remote)

   git push origin master
